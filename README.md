# OpenDXL Samples
This repository consists of sample scripts, and POC scripts that utilize OpenDXL for messaging that I have written for my own personal learning and use case development.  Projects are posted here for prosperity.

## Arduino Switch Event Generator
The concept is that an Arduino with a button or a magnetic switch could be used to detect when a cabinet is opened and send a message to a central logging location using OpenDXL. This project resulted in the creation of two scripts:

arduino_switch_dxlevent.py

arduino_switch_listener.py
